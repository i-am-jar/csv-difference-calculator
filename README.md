When should I use this application?:

Let's say you have two spreadsheets that share the same columns

You would like to subtract a column in both spreadsheets

This application will ask for an input of a column that is the same on both spreadsheet

For example if we have two CSV's that share a column named 'Address' with all of the same addresses, we would input the column name 'Address'

It will then ask for the column that you would like subtracted.

Your output will be a new spreadsheet that shows all of the old values, with a new column that subtracts the specified column.

NOTE: CSV File 1 is being subtracted by CSV File 2"# csv-difference-calculator"
